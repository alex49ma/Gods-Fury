# Gods Fury

You are a human that climbed the Olympus and stole the power of the eleventh god. You made it and now you have the Anemo power (Wind), but the rest of the gods want to kill you and recover the power.

Your mission is to successfully escape without dying. To succeed you will have to fight them while going down the Olympus.
